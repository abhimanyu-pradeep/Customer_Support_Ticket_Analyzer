Simulated Developer Conversation: Multi-Agent Customer Support Ticket Analyzer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User:
Hey, I’m trying to run this multi-agent support ticket analyzer I’m building. How should I structure the files and run it locally?

ChatGPT:
Sure! Make sure your directory looks like this:

your_project/
├── main.py
├── agents/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base_agent.py
│   ├── technical_analyzer.py
│   └── customer_context.py
├── evaluation/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── evaluator.py
│   └── test_cases.py

Then install Pydantic if you haven’t:

pip install pydantic

And simply run:

python main.py

It will process predefined test cases and print results along with evaluation metrics.

User:
Awesome. I’m curious—how does the TechnicalAnalyzerAgent actually assign categories to tickets?

ChatGPT:
Good question. The agent uses a basic keyword-matching heuristic. For example:

- If it sees “crash,” “500 error,” or “backend,” it assigns `Technical - Backend/Service`
- If it detects “UI glitch,” “misaligned,” or “visual,” it assigns `Technical - Frontend/UI`
- Keywords like “rate limit,” “timeout,” map to `Technical - API`

It doesn’t use machine learning—it’s deterministic and rule-based for clarity.

---

User:
Okay, and what if the TechnicalAnalyzerAgent and CustomerContextAgent give different priorities?

ChatGPT:
That’s where the orchestrator comes in. The process_ticket() function collects outputs from both agents. For priority, it takes the highest one suggested by either agent.

This way, if the customer is enterprise (high business impact) but the technical issue looks minor, the orchestrator still escalates it.

---

User:
What happens if one of the agents doesn’t return a value—say, fails to detect anything?

ChatGPT:
The orchestrator has basic checks. If an agent’s output is incomplete (e.g., missing category or priority), it defaults to a safe fallback or defers to the other agent’s suggestion.

The system also logs this behavior, so you can track gaps in agent performance.

---

User:
Why not just use an LLM or a classification model instead of rules?

ChatGPT:
Great point. This version is meant to demonstrate the multi-agent structure and coordination using clear, explainable logic. It’s easier to debug, audit, and extend.

That said, you can absolutely swap out the rule logic for LLM calls or fine-tuned models in each agent while still using Pydantic to structure the inputs/outputs.

---

User:
Makes sense. How is performance measured? I saw some metrics printed at the end.

ChatGPT:
The evaluator.py script calculates several metrics:

- Inter-Agent Category Agreement: % of cases where both agents agree on the category  
- Inter-Agent Priority Agreement: Same, but for priority  
- Output Completeness: Ensures the final output has all required fields  
- Average Reasoning Length: How detailed the orchestrator's explanations are  
- Simulated Correctness Score: A heuristic score based on routing logic and customer context  

These are designed to test not just accuracy, but consistency and completeness across agents.

---

User:
Interesting. What’s considered a complete output in this system?

ChatGPT:
A complete output must contain non-empty values for:

- category
- priority
- recommended_team
- reasoning

If any of those are missing, it’s flagged as incomplete in the evaluation phase.

---

User:
If I wanted to add another agent, like a SentimentAnalyzer, how would I do that?

ChatGPT:
You’d create a new file under agents/, say sentiment_analyzer.py, and follow the structure of existing agents:

- Inherit from BaseAgent
- Implement the analyze() method
- Return an AgentOutput

Then, update the process_ticket() orchestrator to include that agent and adjust decision logic accordingly—e.g., factor in negative sentiment when deciding priority.

---

User:
How scalable is this system? Can it handle thousands of tickets?

ChatGPT:
The current version is designed for clarity and modularity, not speed. However, because each agent is stateless and independent, you could easily parallelize ticket processing using asyncio, multiprocessing, or even serve it via FastAPI for real-time handling.

For production-scale use, you’d also want:

- Agent caching or batching
- Logging and monitoring
- Better fault-tolerance for agent failure

---

User:
Last one—can this be used in domains beyond customer support?

ChatGPT:
Absolutely. This architecture is domain-agnostic. You could adapt it for:

- Bug triaging in software engineering
- HR ticket management
- Legal case tagging
- Medical triage based on symptoms and patient history

All you need to do is specialize your agents based on new roles and adapt the orchestration logic accordingly.
